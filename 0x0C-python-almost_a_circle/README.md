0x0C. Python - Almost a circle
This project is part of the Higher Level curriculum at ALX School. It covers various concepts in Python programming and object-oriented programming (OOP). The project focuses on topics such as import, exceptions, classes, private attributes, getter/setter methods, class methods, static methods, inheritance, unittest module, and reading/writing files.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Explain the concept of unit testing and implement it in a large project
Serialize and deserialize a class
Write and read JSON files
Understand and use *args and **kwargs in Python
Handle named arguments in functions
Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All files should end with a new line
The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
Code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for style checking
All files must be executable
File length will be tested using wc
All modules, classes, and functions should be documented
Python Unit Tests
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All files should end with a new line
All test files should be inside a folder named tests
unittest module must be used
All test files should be python files (extension: .py)
All test files and folders should start with test_
Test file organization should mirror the project's file structure
All tests should be executed using python3 -m unittest discover tests
Project Tasks
0. If it's not tested it doesn't work
All files, classes, and methods must be unit tested and PEP 8 validated.

1. Base class
Create a class Base in the file models/base.py. The Base class will serve as the base for all other classes in this project. It will manage the id attribute to avoid code duplication.

2. First Rectangle
Create a class Rectangle in the file models/rectangle.py that inherits from the Base class. It represents a rectangle and has private instance attributes for width, height, x, y.

3. Validate attributes
Update the Rectangle class to validate the attributes passed to the class constructor and the setter methods.

4. Area first
Add a method def area(self): to the Rectangle class that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.

5. Display #0
Add a method def display(self): to the Rectangle class that prints the rectangle using the # character.

6. str
Override the __str__ method in the Rectangle class to provide a string representation of the rectangle instance.

7. Display #1
Update the display method in the Rectangle class to take into account the x and y coordinates.

8. Update #0
Add a method def update(self, *args): to the Rectangle class that assigns an argument to each attribute of the rectangle.

9. Update #1
Add a method def update(self, *args, **kwargs): to the Rectangle class that assigns a key/value argument to attributes of the rectangle.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
  $ git clone https://github.com/Mugambi12/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x0C-python-almost_a_circle
Navigate to the project directory:
  $ cd your_repository
Compile the Python files (if needed):
  $ chmod +x *.py
Run the unit tests:
  $ python3 -m unittest discover tests
Start implementing the required classes and methods based on the project tasks.
File Descriptions
models/ directory: Contains the Python files defining the classes for the project.
tests/ directory: Contains the Python files for unit tests.
models/base.py: Defines the Base class.
